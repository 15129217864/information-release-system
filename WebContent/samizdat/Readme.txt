                        JConfig 2.2.0
                  -----------------------


PURPOSE:
JConfig is a Java library that provides advanced file, file-type,
and process handling. It fills in the gaps in the core Java API.
It runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix, and most other platforms,
and it includes the complete source code (Java and C++.)

For instance, you can enumerate the user's hard drives, launch
processes, get the file type of a file, launch the user's default
web browser, and perform many other functions which are difficult
or impossible using just the built-in Java libraries.
